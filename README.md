# Language Evolution Through Immigration Dynamics - Interactive Application

## üåç Application Overview

This interactive application allows you to explore **Language Evolution Through Immigration Dynamics** using agent-based modeling. It simulates how cultural norms evolve when populations with different linguistic features come into sustained contact through immigration.

## üî¨ What the App Does

The application models the evolution of Portuguese language features under the influence of Brazilian immigration to Portugal. Using agent-based modeling, it tracks how 4 key linguistic features (vocabulary, grammar, phonetics, pronouns) change over time across two populations (locals and migrants) distributed across 18 Portuguese districts.

### Core Research Question
How do cultural traits evolve when immigrant and host populations interact? Does immigration lead to cultural assimilation, hybrid forms, or bidirectional influence?
